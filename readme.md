Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category;

A statiscally typed programming language performs type checking at compile time. It will not compile if it contains errors, it will only compile if the errors are fixed.  It requires the data types of the variable to be declared.
Examples of statistically typed programming language are; Java, C, C++, C#, Rust, Go, Kotlin, Swift, Fortran, Pascal, and COBOL. 

A dynamically typed programming language is a weak type of language because the value is determined at the end result. Its variable can be changed based on the value assigned to it. It performs type cheking at run time. It can compile even if they contain errors that can prevent them from running properly. They do not declare the data type of the variables. They are more flexible and saves more time and space when writing.
Examples of dynamically typed programming languages are; python, R, PHP, Grooovy, Objective-C, Ruby, Lua, Dart, and Perl.

Differentiate between the JavaScript data types ‘null’ and ‘undefined;
The null data type represents empty.
The undefined data type is used when a variable has not been assigned a value.
